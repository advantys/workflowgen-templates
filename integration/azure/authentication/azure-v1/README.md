# OpenID Connect authentication examples
This section of the templates are examples of OpenID Connect (OIDC)
authentication with third-party applications that requests WorkflowGen GraphQL
API with the access token provided by the identity provider (Azure V1) at the
end if the authentication flow terminated successfully.

# Overview
Each examples in this directory is doing the same thing functionally:

1. It initiates an authentication flow to retreive the identity of the user.
1. After a successful authentication flow, it requests the GraphQL API with
an access token.

The only example that is different is the client credentials example which is a
daemon that requests the GraphQL API periodically to retreive a list of actions
to do.

# Available examples
This folder is separated by authentication flow and technology used. Here's a
table that explains each on of them:

| Folder | Flow | Technology | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auth-code-netfx | Authorization Code | .Net Framework 4.7 WebForms | Server-side web applications must use the authorization code flow of the OpenID Connect protocol in order to be secure. The server **must store securely** the client secret generated by the identity provider. This approach is for a classic technology with today tools such as NuGet and OWIN. |
| authorization-code | Authorization Code | .Net Core 2.2 Razor | Server-side web applications must use the authorization code flow of the OpenID Connect protocol in order to be secure. The server **must store securely** the client secret generated by the identity provider. This is a more modern approach to the flow using a modern framework. |
| client-credentials | Client Credentials | .Net Core 2.2 Console | The client credentials flow is part of the oAuth 2.0 protocol and is not part of OpenID Connect. This flow doesn't return an Id token because there is no user for this type of application. Keep in mind that this flow is suited for server side scripts and daemons. |
| implicit-grant | Implicit Grant | .Net Core 2.2 and React.js | The implicit grant flow is suited for client side applications that resides inside the browser. There are no API on the browser that enables the application to securely store a secret. This flow doesn't require a client secret nor does it return a refresh token for token refreshment. |
| auth-code-pkce | Authorization Code with PKCE | React-Native, iOS 12 and Android 9 | This flow is suited for native client side applications such as mobile applications, Windows XAML or WinForms, macOS applications and such. It doesn't require a client secret because the application cannot guarantee its safety because the application can be decompiled. Instead, an exchange of cryptographic codes will be done with the identity provider. |
