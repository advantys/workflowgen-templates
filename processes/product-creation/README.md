# New Product Creation

The objective of this process is to manage and optimize the various steps in the creation of a new product.

The business proposal is defined by the Marketing Department, then validated by Planning, which also determines the need for regulatory compliance. Then, parallel processing of the subsequent process steps allows Manufacturing, Purchasing, and Finance to analyze and complete the request with Master Data associated with their respective areas of activity.

The Operations Department finalizes the request by confirming the anticipated launch date and authorizing the creation of a new reference in the ERP.
