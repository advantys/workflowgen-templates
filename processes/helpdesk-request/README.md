# Helpdesk Request

The objective of this process is to manage and optimize the handling, processing, and resolution of IT Helpdesk requests from internal and external clients.

The client launches a request \(called a support ticket\) in order to describe the issue encountered at the software or hardware level, providing as much information as possible in order to facilitate comprehension of the problem and its potential cause. Level 1 Support classifies the ticket and decides which actions to take next; this could be a request for further information from the requester, initiation of a call or remote session, sending a solution, or escalation to Level 2 Support. Once the IT Helpdesk’s reply or solution has adequately resolved the issue, the ticket is closed.

### Participants involved

* Requester
* Level 1 Support
* Level 2 Support
* Supervisor

### Benefits

* Real-time requester tracking of support ticket handling and processing.
* Improved quality of service and reduced handling and resolution time for support tickets.
* Self-service support team action assignment and handling by the first available person.
* Classification of the ticket at the first level and escalation to the second level if necessary optimizes the utilization of expertise required to resolve the issue.
* Application of support standards and best practices \(e.g. ITIL\).
* Leveraging of ticket resolutions for similar problems through pre-filled fields or drop-downs and knowledge base search.
* Exploitation of WorkflowGen’s integrated follow-up and reporting functions by support team supervisors to efficiently coordinate the handling of tickets.

### Examples of value-added integration

* Databinding of form drop-down lists to IT resource management applications or global lists managed in WorkflowGen in order to gather information on the requester’s hardware\/software configurations.
* Knowledge base update via a system action at the end of the process.
* Automatic launch of pre-filled support requests upon alerts from third-party applications.
