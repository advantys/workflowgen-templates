# Work Order

The objective of this process is to manage and optimize works and repairs in company buildings and facilities, academic campuses, and geographic areas managed by local governments.

The requester, as the facilities management point of contact, launches a request upon having gathered all pertinent information on the location and nature of the work, indicating the level of urgency and\/or the due date as required. The facilities manager then analyzes the request and obtains more information from the requester if necessary, then assigns the request to the technician who will confirm the date the work will be carried out. Upon completion and passing quality assurance, the requester closes the request.

### Participants involved

* Requester
* Facilities coordinator
* Technician
