# IT Clearance

The objective of this process is to manage and optimize requests for IT clearance for applications managed by different departments within the company.

The supervisor of the employee for whom the request is being made selects the applications for IT clearance. The department manager validates the request and upon approval, the various services in charge of the requested applications can transmit their decisions in parallel. WorkflowGen synchronizes the services’ responses and, based on the decisions, the request is sent to the IT department which will then create the necessary accounts.

### Participants involved

* Requester
* Supervisor
* Department Manager
* Sales Department
* Accounting
* Human Resources
* IT Department

### Benefits

* Real-time requester tracking of request handling and processing.
* Improved quality of service and reduced processing time of stages of validation and creation of accounts.
* Parallelized participant actions synchronized by WorkflowGen greatly reduces processing time.
* Application of IT standards and best practices \(e.g. ITIL\).
* Request traceability and automatic archiving of closed requests.

### Examples of value-added integration

* Databinding of form drop-down lists to IT database of available application modules, sub-modules, and user profiles, or to global lists managed in WorkflowGen.
* Selection from automatically generated application lists based on the requester’s duties.
* Approval from the participants involved launches a system action that creates user accounts directly in the applications and sends the information to the requester without the need for human intervention by the IT Department.
* IT Clearance requests populate application database that manages user permissions, which can also be used in user account modification or deletion processes.
* IT Clearance requests can be incorporated as sub-processes of new employee management processes.
* Expiry dates can be associated with accounts, allowing WorkflowGen to automatically launch user account extension or deletion processes.
